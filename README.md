## Skills App

This app was build as part of a class by [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://elevenfifty.org).

This is the server-side code. The client-side code is [here](https://github.com/nickbirch/red-badge-skill-app-server).

You can find a deployed version of this app on Heroku [here](https://github.com/nickbirch/red-badge-skill-app-client).

It is a React App, built with TypeScript, Class Components, and styled with MaterialUI on the client side and NodeJS, Express, Postgresql, and Sequelize.

## What does the app do?

It allows a user to add skills to their profile by searching through a pre-populated list of skill tags. Users can mark skills as "Acively Learning" to organize their current learning priorities. Users can also add Learning Resources and add skill tags to them so other users can also find them.
